# Roulette Betting System - Complete Requirements
Date: 2025-10-02

## System Overview
A command-line roulette betting system that implements a complex Stage 1 betting strategy with sequence codes, A1 wait rules, four corner loss rules, and mixed numbers for loss/recovery tracking.

## Core Components

### 1. Lists and Numbers
- **A1**: [2,3,5,6,17,18,20,21,25,26,28,29,31,32,34,35] (16 corner bet numbers)
- **A2**: [1-6,13-18,19-24,25-30,31-36] (30 six-line bet numbers)
- **Outcomes**: [0,15,27,33,26,14,36,2,16,22,7,17,30,22,28,9,10,11,6,1,33,10,15,18,11,9,1,7,29,29,36,36]

### 2. Win/Loss Determination
- **Win ('W')**: If outcome is in A1 list
- **Loss ('L')**: If outcome is NOT in A1 list

### 3. Bet Progression System
- **Bet1**: 5 chips on A2 numbers (+1 profit if win, -5 if lose)
- **Bet2**: 4 chips on A1 numbers (+5 profit if win, -4 if lose)
- **Bet3**: 8 chips on A1 numbers (+10 profit if win, -8 if lose)
- **Progression**: After win → Reset to Bet1, After loss → Next bet type
- **Stage End**: If Bet3 loses → Stage 1 ends
- **Display**: Actual bet column shows "Bet 1", "Bet 2", "Bet 3"

### 4. Sequence Codes
- **Initial**: a=3, b=4, c=2
- **Trigger**: Start recording after first A1 win
- **Win Formula**:
  - if a > 13 then a = 10
  - if 10 < a < 14 then a = a-4
  - if 7 < a < 11 then a = a-3
  - if a < 8 then a = a-2
  - b = b - c
  - c = (int(b/a)) * 2
- **Loss Formula**:
  - a = a + 1
  - b = b + c
  - c = (int(b/a)) * 2
- **Special Rule**: If b > 89 then b = int((b+1)/2)

### 5. A1 Wait Rule
- **Trigger**: After any A1 win (outcome in A1 AND bet wins)
- **Effect**:
  - Betting STOPS (no actual bets placed)
  - Sequence codes CONTINUE to be calculated and recorded
- **Wait Condition**: 3 consecutive non-A1 outcomes
- **Reset**: Any A1 outcome during wait resets counter to 0
- **Resume**: Betting resumes on line AFTER 3rd consecutive non-A1 outcome

### 6. Four Corner Loss Rule
- **Trigger**: After 4 consecutive non-A1 outcomes
- **Effect**: Calculate new sequence codes but don't record them on next line
- **Wait**: System waits for A1 outcome to end the rule
- **Resume**: Pending codes are recorded on line AFTER A1 outcome

### 7. Mixed Numbers System
- **Purpose**: Track losses and recoveries using base-4 chip system
- **Format**: integer.decimal where integer = units of 4 chips, decimal = individual chips
- **Loss Recording**:
  - 5 chips loss = -2.3 mixed number (-2×4 + 3 = -8+3 = -5)
  - 4 chips loss = -1.0 mixed number (-1×4 = -4)
  - 8 chips loss = -2.0 mixed number (-2×4 = -8)
- **Win Recovery** (Bet2/Bet3 on A1):
  - Reduce negative by bet units: Bet2 (+1), Bet3 (+2)
  - Add Built-in Profit (BIP): 1 unit = 1 chip, 2 units = 2 chips
  - Display: negative column shows integer part, positive shows mixed number
  - Recovery: When negative + positive ≥ 0, add net profit to balance
- **Display Rules**:
  - Losses: Show cumulative negative integer, decimal in positive (first loss only)
  - Wins: Show final negative/positive mixed numbers, then reset after display

## Program Flow

### Phase 1: Initialization
1. Load outcomes list
2. Set initial sequence codes (3,4,2)
3. Initialize all counters and flags

### Phase 2: Wait for First A1 Win
- Process outcomes until first A1 win occurs
- Record outcomes with no bets, no sequence codes

### Phase 3: Active Betting Phase
For each outcome:
1. **Check A1 Wait Rule**
   - If active: no betting, but continue sequence codes
   - Track consecutive non-A1 outcomes to end wait

2. **Display Sequence Codes**
   - Apply pending codes from four corner rule if available
   - Show current codes (unless four corner rule suppresses)

3. **Place Bet** (if not in A1 wait)
   - Use current bet progression (Bet1/Bet2/Bet3)
   - Update balance and bet progression
   - Handle mixed numbers for losses and wins

4. **Track Four Corner Rule**
   - Count consecutive non-A1 outcomes
   - Trigger rule after 4 consecutive non-A1
   - End rule when A1 outcome appears

5. **Update Sequence Codes**
   - Always update (even during A1 wait)
   - Based on A1 win/loss, not bet win/loss
   - Apply special b > 89 rule if needed

6. **Handle Mixed Numbers**
   - Record losses in negative/positive columns
   - Process recovery for Bet2/Bet3 wins
   - Reset mixed numbers after recovery

7. **Check A1 Wait Trigger**
   - If A1 win occurred, start A1 wait rule

### Phase 4: End Conditions
- Bet3 loss → Stage 1 ends
- All outcomes processed → Display results

## Key Implementation Notes

### Critical Logic Separations
1. **Betting Logic**: Independent of sequence codes
2. **Sequence Codes**: Always update, even during A1 wait
3. **A1 Wait Rule**: Affects betting only, not sequence codes
4. **Four Corner Rule**: Affects sequence code display timing only
5. **Mixed Numbers**: Track losses/recovery separately from normal balance

### Timing Rules
- Sequence codes calculated AFTER outcome, applied to NEXT line
- A1 wait rule stops betting but continues sequence codes
- Four corner rule delays sequence code recording by 2 lines
- Betting resumes line AFTER wait periods end

### DataFrame Output
- Empty values shown as empty strings (not NaN)
- Balance only shown when bets are placed (wins or recovery)
- Sequence codes continue during A1 wait periods
- Four corner rule creates gaps in sequence code display
- Mixed numbers display in negative/positive columns during loss sequences
- Actual bet column shows "Bet 1", "Bet 2", "Bet 3" format

## Technical Specifications
- Language: Python with pandas
- Starting bank: $1000 (1 chip = $1)
- DataFrame columns: ['line', 'outcome', 'win', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'actual bet', 'negative', 'positive', 'balance']
- All calculations use integer arithmetic
- Mixed numbers use base-4 system for loss/recovery tracking
- No external dependencies beyond pandas

## Stage 1 Status
